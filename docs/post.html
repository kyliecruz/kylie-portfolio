      <h1>Launching the Waterloo AI Association</h1>

        <p>
          As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed, the need for thoughtful safety practices
          and governance structures grows alongside them. Students have a unique role to play in this
          space: we can experiment, build community, and learn responsibly without the same commercial
          pressures faced by industry labs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building early matters. By engaging with topics like interpretability, evaluation, and
          governance frameworks now, students can develop the instincts needed to contribute meaningfully
          later. Communities such as student AI safety groups help make this learning collaborative rather
          than isolating.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why initiatives like the Waterloo AI Association focus not only on technical research,
          but also on discussion, policy awareness, and ethical reflection. Responsible AI requires both
          builders and stewards — and students can be both.
