      <h1>Why AI Safety Needs Student Builders</h1>

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>
          I’m excited to announce the launch of the Waterloo AI Association (WAIA), a student-led community
          focused on responsible artificial intelligence, safety, and governance. WAIA was created to bring
          together students who are interested not only in building AI systems, but also in understanding
          their broader societal impacts.
        </p>

        <p>
          As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed, questions around safety, alignment, and
          governance are becoming increasingly important. While much of this work happens in industry and
          research labs, students are in a unique position to explore these topics early, ask foundational
          questions, and develop good technical and ethical instincts without the pressure of commercial
          deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          WAIA aims to bridge the gap between technical innovation and policy awareness. Our focus includes
          interpretability, evaluation, risk assessment, and the governance frameworks that shape how AI is
          developed and deployed in the real world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through reading groups, speaker events, workshops, and open discussions, WAIA provides a space
          for students from technical and non-technical backgrounds to learn collaboratively.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m excited to grow WAIA alongside other students who care deeply about building AI systems that
          are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with human values.
        </p>
