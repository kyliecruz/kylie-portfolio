      <h1>Why AI Safety Needs Student Builders</h1>

      <div class="post-body">
        <p>
          As AI systems grow increasingly powerful and integrated into society, the importance of AI safety
          and governance cannot be overstated. While much of the focus has been on established researchers
          and industry leaders, I believe that students have a crucial role to play in shaping the future
          of AI safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students bring fresh perspectives, a willingness to experiment, and a collaborative spirit that
          is essential for tackling complex challenges. By engaging with AI safety early in their careers,
          students can contribute to building robust, trustworthy systems while also learning about the
          ethical and societal implications of their work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, student-led initiatives can foster a culture of responsibility and awareness around
          AI development. Through clubs, hackathons, and research projects, students can create communities
          that prioritize safety and ethics alongside technical innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my own experience, founding the Waterloo AI Association (WAIA) has been an incredible journey
          of learning and growth. By bringing together like-minded peers, we have been able to explore AI
          safety topics, host discussions with experts, and work on projects that emphasize responsible AI
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, students are not just the future of AI—they are active participants in its present.
          By embracing their role as builders and thinkers in the AI safety space, students can help ensure
          that AI technologies are developed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.
