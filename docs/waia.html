        <p>
          I’m excited to announce the launch of the Waterloo AI Association (WAIA), a student-led community
          focused on responsible artificial intelligence, safety, and governance. WAIA was created to bring
          together students who are interested not only in building AI systems, but also in understanding
          their broader societal impacts.
        </p>

        <p>
          As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed, questions around safety, alignment, and
          governance are becoming increasingly important. While much of this work happens in industry and
          research labs, students are in a unique position to explore these topics early, ask foundational
          questions, and develop good technical and ethical instincts without the pressure of commercial
          deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          WAIA aims to bridge the gap between technical innovation and policy awareness. Our focus is not
          limited to machine learning techniques alone, but also includes interpretability, evaluation,
          risk assessment, and the governance frameworks that shape how AI is developed and deployed in the
          real world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through reading groups, speaker events, workshops, and open discussions, WAIA provides a space
          for students from computer science, engineering, policy, and related fields to learn collaboratively.
          We believe that responsible AI requires both strong technical understanding and thoughtful engagement
          with ethics, regulation, and social context.
        </p>

        <p>
          This initiative is also about community. Navigating AI safety and governance can feel isolating
          when approached alone, especially as a student. WAIA is meant to be a supportive environment where
          curiosity is encouraged, uncertainty is welcomed, and learning happens collectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m excited to grow WAIA alongside other students who care deeply about building AI systems that
          are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with human values. If you’re interested in AI safety,
          governance, or simply want to learn more, I’d love for you to be part of this journey.
